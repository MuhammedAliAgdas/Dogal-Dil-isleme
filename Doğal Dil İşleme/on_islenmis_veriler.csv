shawshank redemption overrated snoozefest presenting cliched tale redemption fails offer anything remotely fresh
honestly get hype around film characters onedimensional plot feels like recycled version every prison
acting especially tim robbins wooden best found struggling connect characters emotional
cinematography uninspired predictable shots lack visual creativity filmmakers content
dialogue cringeworthy times forced philosophical musings come pretentious rather
fathom people praise soundtrack forgettable little enhance overall viewing
pacing excruciatingly slow making nearly twoandahalfhour runtime feel like eternity kept checking watch wondering something interesting
supposed twist towards end predictable attempt suspense overshadowed films overall lack
shawshanks attempt social commentary shallow lacks depth needed make meaningful impact missed opportunity explore real issues within prison
characters lack authenticity arcs formulaic see resolution coming mile away storytelling
films portrayal prison life romanticized point absurdity reality shawshank far brutal unforgiving
morgan freemans narration touted highlight becomes grating filmmakers trust audience interpret story without constant
courtroom scene melodramatic mess legal proceedings eyerolling riveting amateur attempt creating
symbolism like rock hammer rita hayworth poster feels forced contrived filmmakers wanted spell every metaphor
shawshanks ending disappointingly neat tidy robbing narrative real complexity life tie bow film ignores
films socalled exploration friendship lacks nuance shallow portrayal fails capture complexities challenges inherent real human
shawshanks portrayal prison staff uniformly corrupt lazy narrative choice undermines potential nuanced
films attempt humor falls flat relying tired prison cliches jokes feel place overall somber
central theme redemption hammered home subtlety sledgehammer narrative
films acclaim seems rooted nostalgia genuine appreciation quality cinema relic time good
film leaves mark heart despite pros cons think main
